By June 31 2014 this page will be deleted and links to it re-directed to <a href="http://labs.europeana.eu/api">Europeana Labs</a>.</p>

Differently from other API parameters, the record ID is not supplied via a query parameter, but as part of the path within the URL.

			<p>ORE* <a href="http://www.openarchives.org/ore/1.0/vocabulary#proxy">Proxy</a>. Europeana uses proxies as place-holders for cultural heritage objects within aggregations (whether Europeana aggregations or not) to the end of making assertions about the corresponding cultural heritage objects while distinguishing the provenance of these assertions. This class is used to create aliases of cultural heritage objects to which descriptions are attached. This allows Europeana to keep track of provenance of descriptions. See chapter <em>6.1 Introducing proxies</em> in the <a href="http://www.pro.europeana.eu/documents/900548/770bdb58-c60e-4beb-a687-874639312ba5">EDM primer</a><br/>
