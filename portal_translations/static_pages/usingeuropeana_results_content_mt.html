<h1>Riżultati f'Europeana</h1>

<p>Europeana divides search results into 5 main categories: text, images, video, sound and 3D objects.</p>
<p>The types of items included in each section are:</p>

<ul class="zero">

<li><strong>3D</strong>: virtual 3D representations of objects, architecture or places.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can also sort search results by media type, language, date, country, copyright, or provider using the Refine your search pane of the results screen. See <strong>Fittex Europeana</strong> for more details.</p>

<p>Search results are presented in a grid. You can select how many results to show on a page by selecting an option from the <strong>Results per page</strong> drop-down list either above or below the results. You can select <b>12, 24, 48</b> jew  <b>96</b>.</p>
<p>To navigate through the results pages, select the single arrows that are shown both above and below the results grid. Hit &gt; jew  &lt; to move one page in either direction, or hit the double arrows &gt;&gt; jew  &lt;&lt; to move to the last/first pages. Alternatively, type in the page number of the page you'd like to view.</p>
<p><strong>Further details</strong> of an object can be found by selecting an item in the results list.</p>

<h2>Individual items</h2>

<p>After performing your search, select the item you want to view to find out more about it.</p>
<p>The item page shows you the following:</p>

	<ul class="zero">
		<li><strong>Thumbnail image/preview</strong> - hit the magnifying glass <strong>View</strong> link at the bottom of the thumbnail to see a bigger image and additional information in a new window. To close that window, hit X at the top right.<br> 
		If there are multiple images of the same object, e.g. pages of a book or different views of an object, a carousel of images is displayed under the main thumbnail. You can select items in the carousel or the left and right arrows on the main thumbnail to browse the images.</li>

<li><strong>Rights and licensing</strong> - below each preview image you will find the rights statement indicating the terms on which you may re-use the digital object, including the preview. There are currently 12 rights statements describing the different terms on which re-use is permitted. Clicking on the rights statement will open a new window with a full description of the terms or, in the case of a Creative Commons licence, a link to the licence itself.</li>

<li><strong>View item at</strong> - view the item on the item provider's own website. This is useful, for example, to find additional information and larger images, or to view an item in its fullest form, e.g. a whole book or video.</li>
<li><strong>Share item</strong> - share the item via a range of social media, or to print or email it. Just select the option you want.</li>
<li><strong>Cite on Wikipedia</strong> - this function will help you link to Europeana items and cite them in Wikipedia articles. The code you need is formatted for direct inclusion in Wikipedia's article authoring mode. Select <strong>Citation</strong> jew  <strong>Footnote</strong> and copy and paste the text provided. To close the citation window, hit the X in the top right corner.</li>
<li><strong>Translate details</strong> - select an option from the drop-down list of languages. Please note this is a machine translation.</li>
</ul>

<p>The main area of the item page gives you more information about the item. The amount and type of information will vary but may contain the item's name and description along with other information including places, dates, formats, and providers.</p>

<p>This information may contain links to further details. Select these to find the item in an external service, e.g. the data provider's own website, or to search Europeana for the highlighted term.</p>

<p>To move to the previous or next item in your search results, hit the <strong>Next</strong> jew  <strong>Previous</strong> options.</p>

<p>A carousel showing <strong>Similar content</strong> of up to 10 items related to the one you are viewing. Select an image to view more details.</p>

<p>Another way of finding similar content is to use the links in the <strong>Search also for</strong> pane. This provides links to other searches for items with, for example, the same title, author, format or are from the same provider. A number in brackets, e.g. (33) shows the number of results each of these searches returns. Simply hit the link to perform the search.</p>
