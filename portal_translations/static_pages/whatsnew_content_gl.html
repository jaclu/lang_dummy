<h1>What's New</h1>

<p>We've made some changes so that as well as having a fresh new look and feel, it's now easier for you to discover and explore Europeana's treasures.</p>

<p>One of the biggest changes is that the site is now responsive. That means it automatically adapts to a range of different devices and screen sizes. So whether you're using a touchscreen smartphone or a large desktop, the portal will tailor its presentation so the layout always suits the screen.</p>

<p>Searching is even easier with new automatic suggestions that pop up as you type. We'll predict what you're looking for and make recommendations based on that, before you’ve even finished typing.</p>

<p>The new homepage includes a stronger focus on our curated content, with a bigger image slideshow, a featured partner section and a great carousel highlighting our latest pins on Pinterest.</p>

<p>For the developers amongst you, we have also released the Europeana API (Application Programming Interface) v2.0 with an improved console and new features. Register for API keys <a href="api/registration.html" title="You can register for your API key here">here</a>.</p>

<p>We hope you enjoy using the new-look Europeana.</p>
