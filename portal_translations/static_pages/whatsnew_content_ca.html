<p>We've made some changes so that as well as having a fresh new look and feel, it's now easier for you to discover and explore Europeana's treasures.</p>

<p>One of the biggest changes is that the site is now responsive. That means it automatically adapts to a range of different devices and screen sizes. So whether you're using a touchscreen smartphone or a large desktop, the portal will tailor its presentation so the layout always suits the screen.</p>

<p>Searching is even easier with new automatic suggestions that pop up as you type. We'll predict what you're looking for and make recommendations based on that, before youâ€™ve even finished typing.</p>

<p>The new homepage includes a stronger focus on our curated content, with a bigger image slideshow, a featured partner section and a great carousel highlighting our latest pins on Pinterest.</p>

<p>For the developers amongst you, we have also released the Europeana API (Application Programming Interface) v2.0 with an improved console and new features. Register for API keys <a href="api/registration.html" title="You can register for your API key here">here</a>.</p>

<p>We hope you enjoy using the new-look Europeana.</p>
