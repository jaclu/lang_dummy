<h1>Accessibility</h1>
<p>
Europeana.eu features and content have been designed to be universally
accessible by users and user agents/devices. We strive to meet the WC3 Web
Content Accessibility Guidelines Version 1.0.
</p>
<p>
Our User Centred Design team frequently conducts usability testing of
Europeana.eu navigation, flow, labels, and consistency. Furthermore,
we will produce a version &ndash; post this prototype phase &ndash; for blind individuals.
</p>
<p>
Some of the accessibility features of our site include:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Meaningful page titles to help with orientation</li>
<li>Almost all images have either a meaningful alt-text (text equivalent)</li>
<li>Minimal use of frames</li>
<li>Use of resizable fonts</li>
<li>Use Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) to separate content from presentation</li>
<li>Notifying a user when a link opens a new window</li>
<li>The (core) functionalities are usable without JavaScript</li>
</ul>

<p>
