Europeana.eu follows similar policy guidelines to <a class="external fn url" href="http://europa.eu/" target="_blank" title="Click here to visit the Europa website">Europa</a> (portal Europske unije)
</p>

<p><strong><i>
As far as possible, the aim is to provide the public with the information they
are looking for in their own language. However, due to constraints on resources,
this isn't always possible
</i></strong></p>

<p>
Therefore the following guidelines apply in Europa and will
apply in Europeana.eu:
</p>
<ul>
<li>all top (*) level pages in all full partner languages</li>
<li>prioritise speed of publication over availability of translation</li>
<li>Allow limited 'language mixing' (**) i.e.: where a warning sign needs to be displayed</li>
</ul>


<p>
(*) i.e.: the navigation, search, retrieval and display interfaces
</p>
<p>
(**) Language mixing = more than one language on a page
</p>

<p>
U praktičnom smislu to znači sljedeće:
</p>
<ol class="number">
<li>Tools to manage translation will be developed and maintained by Europeana.eu</li>
<li>The completion of the translations will be the responsibility of
each designated volunteer partner institution</li>
<li>These are unofficial translations and may not correspond exactly with the English version</li>
<li>Europeana.eu will notify each designated volunteer partner
institution should an update be required but will not chase for that
update</li>
<li>Information that is urgent or has a very short life is in
English only e.g.: Ad-hoc error messages</li>
<li>All surveys about the site will be produced in all
feasible languages only</li>
<li>Search Engine Promotion to be executed in English, in the
first instance</li>
<li>The Management section and the technical information will
be maintained solely in English, as the working language of
Europeana.eu</li>
<li>If, however, an individual institution wishes to translate and maintain
any of the above from within their own resources, Europeana.eu would be happy
to enable its display</li>
</ol>
<p>The translations are made on a voluntary basis by our partners and are for information only. The legally valid text is in English only.</p>
