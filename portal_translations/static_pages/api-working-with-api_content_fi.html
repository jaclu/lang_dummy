<h1>Working with the API </h1>

<p class="banner-redirect">We have recently released a new developer portal called <a href="http://labs.europeana.eu/api">Europeana Labs</a> where all the documentation and information about the Europeana APIs is available. The page you're viewing now is deprecated and will not be updated with any changes. By June 31 2014 this page will be deleted and links to it re-directed to <a href="http://labs.europeana.eu/api">Europeana Labs</a>.</p> 

<p>In this section you will find general information that is relevant to all the API methods.</p>

<h3>Request</h3>

<p>Every API call is an HTTP request in a specified format that is sent to the Europeana API service.<br/>
The API root URL is located at: <a href="http://www.europeana.eu/api/v2">http://www.europeana.eu/api/v2</a>.</p>

<a name="Authentication"><b>Authentication Parameter</b></a>

<p>Every API call must be provided a special authentication parameter <i>wskey</i>. This parameter should contain your private key that you got during the registration process.</p>

<a name="Response"><h3>Response</h3></a>

<p>Every response to an API call will contain a number of standard fields that precede the fields specific for the call. The standard part contains the following fields:</p>

<table class="bordered">
	<thead>
		<tr>
			<th>Field</th>
			<th>Data&nbsp;type<a title="API1-API2 Mapping" href="api-introduction.html#data-types">*</a></th>

		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>params</td>

		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>


<a name="Error-Codes"><h3>Error Codes</h3></a>

<p>An error during processing of an API method is reported by (1) a relevant HTTP status code, (2) a value of the success field and  (3) a meaningful error message in the error field (see the <a title="Response" href="/portal/api-working-with-api.html#Response">Response</a> section).</p>

<p>The following HTTP status codes are returned:</p>

<table  class="bordered">
	<thead>
		<tr>
			<th>HTTP Status Code</th>
			<th>Description</th>
		</tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>200</td>
			<td>The request was executed successfully.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>401</td>
			<td>Authentication credentials were missing or authentication failed.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>404</td>
			<td>The requested record was not found.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
