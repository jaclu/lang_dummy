<h1>How to configure your search widget</h1>
<p>You can add a Europeana search facility to your blog or website. <a href="widget/editor.html">Our simple wizard</a> takes you through the process step-by-step and gives you a snippet of code to embed.</p>
<p>Configure the widget to search all collections and data providers within Europeana, or refine it to suit your website, e.g. to search only within Public Domain or Creative Commons, or only licensed images from a specific country.</p>
<h2>The Europeana Search Widget works with...</h2>
<p>Sites that you host yourself.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Blogger/Blogspot</li>
	<li>Tumblr</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Europeana Search Widget doesn't work with...</h2>

<h2>Set up your Europeana Search Widget:</h2>
<ol>
	<li>Go to the search widget page.</li>
	<li><strong>Introduction tab</strong>: The Europeana Search widget is presented. A progress bar shows you how far you are through the process and a video takes you through the process step by step. To start configuring your widget, tap 'Next' or the 'Filter' tab heading.</li>
	<li><strong>Filter tab</strong>: If you want your widget to include the entire Europeana dataset, you can go straight to the 'Style' tab. Tap 'Next' or the 'Style' tab heading.</li>
	<p>To tailor your search widget: </p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Keyword search</strong>: By default, the widget searches the entire Europeana dataset. You can restrict the search to a key word or phrase. To do this, enter the key word(s) in the 'Search for' field. For example, if you are adding a widget to your First World War blog about military uniform, you might type 'uniform'.<br>
		All the normal search functions work in this field, for example, use double quotes for a phrase, e.g. &quot;military uniform&quot;, use 'AND' to include searches on two words or 'NOT' to hide results for a particular word, e.g. 'uniform AND war' or 'uniform NOT school'.</li>
		<li><strong>Search on types</strong>: By default, the widget will search the entire Europeana dataset for your key words. You can restrict the search to 'Titles', 'Creators', 'Subjects', 'Times/Periods', or 'Places'.  For example, you may wish to look only for results to do with 'Paris'. In which case, you would enter 'Paris' as a key word and 'Places' as a type. Tap 'Change' next to 'All Fields' and select the option you need.</li>
		<li><strong>Fournisseurs</strong>: By default, the widget returns results from all of Europeana's providers. You can restrict it to your chosen providers.  Tap 'Change' next to 'All  Providers' and select the providers you need. You can search for a provider using the search field above the list.  The providers are presented in order of the size of their contributions to Europeana. The number in brackets shows how many items from that provider are available. If the name of the provider is followed by an arrow, then they are a data aggregator, tap the arrow to see the institutions included in their collection. Note: you can select more than one.</li>
		<li><strong>Countries</strong>: By default, the widget returns results from all countries. You can restrict it to your chosen countries. Tap 'Change' next to 'All Providing Countries' and select the countries you need. The countries are presented in order of the size of their contributions to Europeana. The number in brackets shows how many items from that country are available. Note: you can select more than one. To clear your selection and start again, tap 'Clear'.</li>
		<li><strong>Media types</strong>: By default, the widget returns results of all media types - image, text, sound, video and 3D. You can restrict it to only the media types you're interested in. Tap 'Change' next to 'All Media Types' and select the types you need. The media types are presented in order of size. The number in brackets shows how many items of that media type are available. Note: you can select more than one.  To clear your selection and start again, tap 'Clear'.</li>
		<li><strong>Copyright</strong>: By default, the widget returns results with any copyright status. You can restrict this, for example, to only show re-usable content. Tap 'Change' next to 'All Copyrights' and select the statuses you need. The copyright statuses are presented in order of size. The number in brackets shows how many items of that status are available. Note: you can select more than one. To clear your selection and start again, tap 'Clear'.<br>

		<li><strong>Languages</strong>: By default, the widget returns results in all languages. You can restrict it to your chosen languages. Tap 'Change' next to 'All Languages' and select the languages you need. The languages are presented in order of the size of their representation in Europeana. The number in brackets shows how many items of each language are available. Note: you can select more than one. To clear your selection and start again, tap 'Clear'.</li>
		<p>When you have selected all your filters, tap 'Next' or the 'Style' tab heading.</p>
	</ul>
	<li><strong>Style tab</strong>: You can choose a black or white widget and select to include thumbnails or not. Select the style you would like to use.<br>
	Tap 'Next' or the 'Preview' tab heading.</li>
	<li><strong>Preview tab</strong>: Your widget will be displayed. Please note that the widget is responsive and so expands to fit the width of its container. For this reason, it may be a different size on the preview than it will be on your own web page.</li>
</ol>
	<p>If you wish to amend the widget's properties, just go back to the 'Search', 'Filter' or 'Style' tab and make your changes.</p>
	<p>If you are happy with your widget, simply copy the 'Embed' code displayed and paste this into your web page.</p>
