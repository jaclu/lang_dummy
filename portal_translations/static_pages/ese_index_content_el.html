<h1><span rel="dc:creator" resource="http://europeana.eu">Europeana</span>: <span property="dc:title" xml:lang="en">Europeana Semantic Elements (ESE)</span></h1>
<p> The Europeana Semantic elements (ESE) was the first reference metadata set used to describe cultural heritage objects in Europeana. It is a Dublin Core-based application profile providing a generic set of DC elements and some locally coined terms, which have been added specifically to support Europeana&rsquo;s functionalities.</p>
<p>The ESE specifications describe the properties used in ESE, their XML syntax, their usage in the Europeana portal, obligation, occurrence and examples. The full documentation and the XML Schema are available at <a href="http://pro.europeana.eu/ese-documentation/">http://pro.europeana.eu/ese-documentation/</a>.</p>
